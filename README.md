# Adult Income Prediction - 13 Classification Models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person earns more than 50K annually using the Adult Census Income dataset.

I implemented and compared 13 different classification models to evaluate performance and select the best-performing algorithm.
